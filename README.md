A collection of data visualizations using Plotly to analyze everything I bought, sold, and donated in Animal Crossing over 10 days.

Animal Crossing is a social simulation game where you are plopped on a deserted island, and have to build up a village from scratch. It sounds super random, but, as the internet has proved, is incredibly addicting. A huge part of this game involves acquiring items around your island and selling them to expand your home or the island setup. So, I wanted to analyze different trends in the types of items I collect, their cumulative value, and how I can optimize my time to make big bucks in the game. üí∏
